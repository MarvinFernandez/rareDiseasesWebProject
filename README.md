# rareDiseasesWebProject
Web Application which allows the retrieval and consultation of the information stored in the database of resources on Rare Diseases.
To improve the prognosis of rare diseases, it is necessary to optimize the time of diagnosis. The lengthy diagnostic process can have serious implications for people with rare
diseases. Therefore, it could have a very positive impact to have a platform where all the symptoms and signs of each rare disease are found, as well as all the new updated
information, useful for researchers, doctors, and patients. 

With the use of Django, a Web Application was developed, which allows the retrieval and consultation of the information stored in the database of resources on Rare Diseases. 
Through a GUI the access to this information has been improved with respect to previous projects, creating a more intuitive environment for the user. Additionally, 
a communication mechanism was created between users and the administrator of the website, allowing the publication of news and the sending of inquiries. 

Future lines of this project could be adding and updating information, improve the design of the web page, and create a user registration system that allows managing the
different levels of access, such as creating a post or making CRUD on the RDs database.
